# SpreadShare2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/HugoPeters1024/SpreadShare2.svg?token=EzhgBYg4bqpNUB6Jq5aw&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/HugoPeters1024/SpreadShare2)
Using a simple bandwagon algorithm for cryptocurrency trading on Binance

## Setup
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. _(Windows)_ [Share C drive with Docker](https://medium.com/travis-on-docker/why-and-how-to-use-docker-for-development-a156c1de3b24)
3. Create volume postgres-data 
```docker volume create --name postgres-data```
4. Create an `.env` file from the `.env.example` file. Replace the default passwords with randomly generated passwords.
5. Create an `appsettings.yaml` file from the `appsettings.yaml.example` file. Replace the API credentials with actual credentials.
5. Run Visual Studio with Docker Compose configuration or run
```docker-compose up```

### Linux setup
```
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce && docker-compose
docker volume create --name postgres-data
cp .env.example .env
cp SpreadShare/appsettings.json.example SpreadShare/appsettings.yaml
docker-compose up
```

## Development
If you want to run this application without Docker, the framework [.NET Core 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1) is required. Furthermore, please read the [testing documentation](TESTING.md).

### Database migrations
Each time the database schema changes, the following command needs to be ran.
```
dotnet ef migrations add [MigrationTitle]
```

### Database restore
In development, database migrations are replaced not stacked to keep a simple history. This does require a rebuild of the database however. This can be done as follows:
```
cd SpreadShare2/
docker container prune
# EOSETH is an example
sudo cp DataPump/EOSETH.csv DataPump/input-data/
```
Make sure the entry point in SpreadShare/Dockerfile looks like this:
```
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "SpreadShare.dll", "--verbose"]
```
Then run the container, resulting in a fresh migration
```
docker-compose up --build
# Wait for the Datapump to complete
```

Then make sure the entry point in SpreadShare/Dockerfile is set back to normal and run the container again
```
docker-compose up --build
# Wait untill its done loading
```

YouÂ´re done and can now run your python scripts!

### Dawn's Guard plugin
For argument checking, the project consistenly uses the Guard plugin from Dawn. This plugin requires at least C#7.2. You can review the documentation here https://github.com/safakgur/guard

### Code coverage report
To generate a html code coverage report using minicover, you can run the `generate-report.sh` script from within the /SpreadShare.Tests folder. You can enter the exact name of a test class as filter as an optional first argument. When it has finished it will open /SpreadShare/coverage-html/index.html in the default browser using python.

### Architecture
This is a console application written in [ASP.Net Core 2.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-2.1). [Dependency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.1) is used for injecting common dependencies (such as database context and logger factories). Different modules are separated in services which are registered in `Startup.cs` and can be accessed via a `ServiceCollection`. A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database is connected with a database context. This database runs in a separate Docker container. There are three Docker containers in total: SpreadShare, the database and a ZeroMQ-enabled python application.

### Using Docker in development
We have chosen to use Docker in development rather than only using Docker for deployment. This approach allows for a consistent development environment that only requires Docker and easy deployment [[1](https://medium.com/travis-on-docker/why-and-how-to-use-docker-for-development-a156c1de3b24)]. To enable debugging, we required the integration with Docker of Visual Studio. This is configured by adding support for Docker [[2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/docker/visual-studio-tools-for-docker?view=aspnetcore-2.1)]. This results in a Docker Compose run configuration instead of a Spreadshare configuration.

**Disadvantage 1: Unclear error output in Docker configuration**
However, this has a disadvantage. Errors in the `docker-compose.yml` file and the `Dockerfile`s are not displayed clearly in the output. This can be resolved by running `docker-compose build & docker-compose up` in a terminal window. 

**Disadvantage 2: No terminal color support in debug output**
Furthermore, the Visual Studio debug output window does not support special characters and by extensions colors in output ([Github issue](https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/issues/428)). We have disabled the color output using `DisableColors` in `ConsoleLoggerOptions`.

### Splitting debug logs into default output and program output
The debug output contains default output and program output. If you would like to split this output, change the following setting in Visual Studio:
> _Tools -> Visual Studio Options Dialog -> Debugging -> Check the "Redirect All Output Window Text to the Immediate Window"_

### Removing trailing whitespace in a pre-commit hook
Add the following script to `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (no extension)
```bash
find . -name '*.cs' -exec sed -i 's/\s*$//g' {} +
```
You have to set the script executable using `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

Each time you commit, this command will remove trailing whitespace.
